## Comala Workflow Syntax Highlighting

I used <https://github.com/pcanella/vscode-marko> as an example.

Installation instructions:

* Open VS Code
* Open command panel with `âŒ˜ + P` (Mac) or `F1` (Windows)
* Type `ext install comalaworkflow` and it should install right away.
* Not working? Try to get it from the repo directly (<https://github.com/detlefs/vscode-comalaworkflow>), ar contact me via github
